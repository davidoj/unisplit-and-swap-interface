This is a fork of the Uniswap interface that incorporates elements of the Gnosis conditional token explorer to facilitate conditional token exchanges. It doesn't work yet.

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

### Configuring the environment (optional)

To have the interface default to a different network when a wallet is not connected:

1. Make a copy of `.env` named `.env.local`
2. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `"{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}"`
3. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g. `"https://{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}.infura.io/v3/{YOUR_INFURA_KEY}"` 

Note that the interface only works on testnets where both 
[Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/factory/) and 
[multicall](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall) are deployed.
The interface will not work on other networks.

## Accessing Uniswap Interface V1

The Uniswap Interface supports swapping against, and migrating or removing liquidity from Uniswap V1. However,
if you would like to use Uniswap V1, the Uniswap V1 interface for mainnet and testnets is accessible via IPFS gateways 
linked from the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-interface/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
